            <h4 id="dol">What is Defense of Life</h4>
            <div>
                Defense of life (short: DoL, includes self-defense and defense of other players) is defined <a href="#defense"><span class="hover-definition-text" data-term="defense">here</span></a> as using force in response to a <a href="#threat"><span class="hover-definition-text" data-term="threat">threat</span></a>.
                Oftentimes, players are confused as to what constitutes a threat, so we have created this new paragraph with practical examples.
                The following players can be considered a threat to you, or to someone else that you have the right to defend:
                <ul>
                    <li>A player holding a weapon near you while facing you, unless you're in a gun store</li>
                    <li>A player aiming a weapon at you or in your general direction</li>
                    <li>A player shooting at you or in your general direction</li>
                    <li>A player trying to stab you or hit you with a tool or melee weapon</li>
                    <li>A player trying to carjack you</li>
                    <li>A player driving towards you with the intent to run you over or ram your vehicle</li>
                    <li>A player verbally threatening to kill you or harm you in any way</li>
                </ul>
                Keep in mind that the above are only <i>examples</i>, and the rule of thumb is that if an average, reasonable person would feel 
                threatened by the actions of the player in question, then taking them down for Defense of Life is allowed.
                The duration of a threat is short, so you can only act in defense of life when the danger is active.
            </div>

            <br>
            <h4 id="rdm_civs">Part One - Civilians</h4>
            <div>
                <i>The following sections only apply when you are a civilian (any role or job that can gain a wanted level).</i>
            </div>
            
            <div>
                <div class="subtitle">a. Revenge</div>
                <div>
                    Being <a href="#attack"><span class="hover-definition-text" data-term="attack">attacked</span></a>, arrested, killed, robbed, or getting your <a href="#property"><span class="hover-definition-text" data-term="property">property</span></a> 
                    damaged, stolen or seized gives you the right to attack and kill the other player(s) on sight <b>once, within the 
                    same <a href="#game_session"><span class="hover-definition-text" data-term="game_session">game session</span></a></b>. This includes any failed attempts to do those things. If you get 
                    attacked again, your right to obtain revenge is reinstated. The chain of revenge stops when either of the two 
                    players stops seeking their revenge.
                </div>
                <div>
                    It doesn't matter if the incident that resulted in your loss happened when you were a cop or a paramedic,
                    the important thing is that when you take revenge you are not on one of those jobs. You can switch from those
                    jobs to a civilian job to take your revenge if necessary, or you can place a hit contract instead<button class="note-button" data-note-id="note[NOTE_ID]">[NOTE_ID]</button>.
                </div>
                <!--note-->
                <div id="note[NOTE_ID]" class="note-content">
                    <span class="note-id">[NOTE_ID]</span>
                    <span class="note-date">24.10.2024</span>
                    <span class="note-author">Profit</span>
                    <p>
                        The part about placing a hit contract was added to the rules with the October 16th/17th update and seems to express that 
                        police officers and medics are also allowed to apply this rule to use hit contracts in order to get revenge on a player.
                    </p>
                </div>


                <div>
                    When two players simultaneously kill each-other (also known as trading), the revenge is not considered to have been satisfied,
                    thus both players are allowed to find the other player to kill them in revenge.<br>
                </div>
                <div>
                    You are also allowed to send another player to kill your target on your behalf; your right to revenge will
                    be satisfied once the order or contract is completed, and you cannot kill the target again. If you've been 
                    sent to kill someone, you must have evidence that the order or contract has taken place (e.g. a DM screenshot).
                </div>
            </div>

            <div>
                <div class="subtitle">b. Self-defense and defense of friends</div>
                <div>
                    You're allowed to kill an attacker in self-defense or in defense of your <a href="#friend"><span class="hover-definition-text" data-term="friend">friends</span></a>.
                    Whenever you have the reasonable assumption that your life or the life of a friend is being endangered by 
                    another player, you can defend yourself and claim self-defense (or defense of friends).
                    If the attacker(s) are presumably together with other players (e.g. they're in the same vehicle),
                    you are allowed to kill those other players.
                </div>
                <div>
                    Some examples have been mentioned in the "Defense of Life" section above. Here we add a few more practical examples
                    that apply to civilians only:
                    <ul>
                        <li>A player following you or staying nearby without an apparent reason (they're not talking or interacting), unless you're in <a href="#poi"><span class="hover-definition-text" data-term="poi">point of interest</span></a></li>
                        <li>A player following you or staying nearby when they have revenge on you, or a clear reason to kill you</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div>
                <div class="subtitle">c. Defense of property</div>
                <div>
                    You're allowed to kill players in defense of your <a href="#property"><span class="hover-definition-text" data-term="property">property</span></a> and the property of your friends from theft, damage and trespassing.
                    Examples of players you can kill in defense of your property:
                    <ul>
                        <li>A player steals your vehicle (or tries to)</li>
                        <li>A player damages your vehicle (intentionally or not)</li>
                        <li>A player enters your vehicle without your permission</li>
                        <!-- <li>A player breaks into your warehouse or garage</li> -->
                    </ul>

                <div class="subtitle">d. Provoking</div>
                <div>

                            Contrary to popular belief, cops are allowed to camp drug spots. 
                            However cops camping drug spots qualify as "reasonable belief" that the cops are working against a drug dealer criminal who wants to sell drugs in the area, 
                            meaning such a criminal is allowed to kill the cop without it constituting a rule break. See the reports and decisions below.

                                Sasino found that this was allowed, as these two civilians posed a threat to the cop in that situation. Shooting the unarmed civilian was also justified, as these two civilians were a group.

                                A suspect who is driving a car, crashing into an NPC who is in a vehicle and kills said NPC, qualifies as them committing a "violent crime". 
                                If this happens in the presence of a police officer, said officer may apply lethal force. 
                                This also applies even if one can attribute the NPC killing to desync, see the report below.

                            <p>The interpretation of "very recently" is rather controversial. For a while, it was believed that if the crime happened 2 minutes ago or less, police could use lethal force against the suspect. This is currently not the case.</p>
                            <p>Sasino, in a discord message dated 13.09.2023 stated the following: "[...] very recently usually means that the crim is still on the scene of that crime, or very close, and has a high probability to shoot."</p>
                            
                            <p>
                                Sasino, in the same message, also gave this example: "[...] you get a call about a robber robbing a gas station, you get there and the robber is in the car but has just left the gas station, then it's ok to open fire. 
                                But if you chase someone for a while and then start shooting when it's convenient, that's not allowed."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This rule was brought up in this suggestion: <a href="discord://discord.com/channels/738534756538384499/1266824602642808993" target="_blank">Update the written rules [...]</a> (27.07.2024), 
                                where Sasino commented the following: "if you feel it's very recently then just explain why it is", "if you think a mod is being unreasonable just ask for a different mod", 
                                "or ask the mod to gather more opinions".
                            </p>

                            <p>It could seem that "very recently" is meant to be tied closely to the definition of a <a href="#threat">threat</a> based on Sasino's statements.</p>

                            <p>One should exercise caution when invoking this rule as justification for use of lethal force as a police officer, as there are unclear pitfalls and gray areas that could result in a job ban.</p>

                        Medics cannot shoot at someone who ceases to be a threat. In the report below, a person who was a threat to a medic drove away from said medic, while the medic shot at them. 
                        The medic was job banned for shooting at the person who claimed to not be a threat anymore. This ban was appealed and the appeal was accepted by Sasino.

                        The only exception is when the situation was completely out of your control (e.g. lag issues, players suddenly running in the
                        middle of the street, or in front of your line of fire) or when a player uses a cuffed or AFK player as a human shield.

                Exploiting any glitch, bug, script error, unintentional outcome of a certain system, or money/XP loophole of the
                server or GTA V to your advantage is not allowed. Don't exploit or you will get banned and possibly get your progress reset.

            </p>
            <p>
                If you find an exploit, you should report it in a private support ticket. If you don't want to report it, 
                that's fine but sharing it with anyone else or encouraging them to abuse it is not allowed and will get you a ban.

            <h3>5. Do not Combat Log</h3>
            <p>
                Leaving the server to avoid being killed, arrested, penalized by an admin or any other negative consequence that would 
                otherwise have happened is not allowed. It doesn't matter whether you had spawn protection or not.

                Since civilian on civilian RDM is hard to prove, combat logging is not allowed in those cases.

            <h3>6. Do not Evade Bans</h3>
            If you are banned from the server you are expected to wait the full duration of your ban. Circumventing the ban in any way is not allowed;
            if you have multiple accounts, don't use any of them when one is banned, or your ban time will be doubled.

        <div id="rule07">
            <h3>7. Do not Lie to Staff</h3>
            You cannot lie to the staff in the following contexts:
            <ul>
                <li>When reporting a player for breaking a rule</li>
                <li>When appealing a ban or any other kind of infraction</li>
                <li>When claiming a prize, refund, or any kind of bonus</li>

            That doesn't exclusively apply to tickets: it can be anywhere as long as a staff member is involved in the conversation.
            If you are proven to have knowingly lied to a staff member in any of those contexts you will get banned.

            <h3>8. Do not Impersonate Staff</h3>
            Impersonating a staff member is not allowed under any circumstance, and will get you immediately banned.
            Some common occurrences that fall into staff impersonation are:
            <ul>
                <li>Claiming to be part of the staff, or to have been part of the staff in the past</li>
                <li>Claiming to have the power to ban or apply any other kind of account penalty on someone</li>
                <li>Threatening in first person to ban or apply any other kind of account penalty on someone</li>
                <li>Driving a staff vehicle, wearing staff clothing or anyway having the appearance of a staff member</li>
                <li>Using staff powers when not authorized (e.g. an ex-staff member whose permissions haven't been removed yet)</li>

            <h3>9. Do not Advertise</h3>
            Advertising anything that isn't directly related to Cops and Robbers V is not allowed. Advertising means exposing a website, server, community, product
            or any other kind of entity or object in mass with the purpose of attracting users towards it. A simple mention doesn't equate to advertising.
            Advertising cheats or encouraging players to cheat will get you banned in all cases.

                    You are allowed to play music in an area where most of the present players approve. If you move to an area and players 
                    that are already there ask you to turn it down, you must turn it down or move away. If other players come to your location
                    where you were already playing the music, then they must move if they don't wanna listen to it, except if the location is
                    usually crowded, such as spawn locations and popular stores.

                <div class="subtitle">h. Disrespecting moderators</div>
                <div>
                    You must not disrespect a staff member that is actively moderating by insulting them, 
                    or otherwise provoking them or challenging them to punish you.
                    This can get you muted, fined, kicked and even banned in more severe cases. 
                    This rule doesn't apply if the moderator was involved in the conflict in a 
                    negative way; they must have shown a respectful attitude during the conversation.

                    When you agree on a deal that involves trading in-game items and currency, you must complete the deal or give back what you have  
                    received and you must not scam or deceive the other party. The server is not responsible for scams, and we don't guarantee the
